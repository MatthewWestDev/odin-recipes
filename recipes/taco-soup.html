    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty Taco Soup recipe bursts with crave-worthy Mexican flavors, and then it comes together in just 30 minutes. After only 10 minutes of prep work, it’s easy to serve up a warm bowl of this soup loaded with ground beef, tomatoes, corn, beans, and a quick homemade taco seasoning.</p>
    <p>Like our Slow Cooker Beef Chili, this is the perfect bowl of comfort for cooler weather, and it also has the same crowd-pleasing flavors as our irresistible Taco Salad. This Taco Soup is the best of both!</p>

        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
