    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chili recipe has no beans and is packed with flavor. My husband won't eat beans but loves chili, so I had to create this variation on an old favorite. I used lots of canned tomatoes and onion in this dish which is great served over rice with shredded cheese and sour cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Crumble beef into the hot stockpot. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until beef is evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.</li>
    <li>Stir in chili powder, oregano, cumin, and hot sauce. Pour in tomatoes and vinegar; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally to prevent the bottom from burning.</li>
    </ol>
